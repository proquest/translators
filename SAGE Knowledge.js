				"abstractNote": "This issues-based reference set on education in the United States tackles broad, contentious topics that have prompted debate and discussion within the education community. The volumes focus on pre-school through secondary education and explore prominent and perennially important debates. This set is an essential reference resource for undergraduate students within schools of education and related fields including educational administration, educational psychology, school psychology, human development, and more. Education of America's school children always has been and always will be a hot-button issue. From what should be taught to how to pay for education to how to keep kids safe in schools, impassioned debates emerge and mushroom, both within the scholarly community and among the general public. This volume in the point/counterpoint Debating Issues in American Education reference series tackles the topic of alternative schooling and school choice. Fifteen to twenty chapters explore such varied issues as charter schools, for-profit schools, faith-based schools, magnet schools, vouchers, and more. Each chapter opens with an introductory essay by the volume editor, followed by point/counterpoint articles written and signed by invited experts, and concludes with Further Readings and Resources, thus providing readers with views on multiple sides of alternative schooling and school choice issues and pointing them toward more in-depth resources for further exploration.",

Comprehensive and inclusive, its interdisciplinary scope covers such varied fields as anthropology, communication and media studies, criminal justice, economics, education, geography, human services, management, political science, psychology, and sociology. In addition, while not a discipline, methodology is at the core of these fields and thus receives due and equal consideration. At the same time we strive to be comprehensive and broad in scope, we recognize a need to be compact, accessible, and affordable. Thus the work is organized in A-to-Z fashion and kept to a single volume of approximately 600 to 700 pages.",

				"abstractNote": "In the last twenty years accounting history literature has been enriched by the widened examination of historical events from different paradigmatic perspectives. These debates have typically pitted “traditional” historians against “critical” historians. The 47 articles in this three-volume set delineate the basic tenets of these rival paradigms. They include the work of prominent scholars from both camps. Volumes I and II reach across key managerial and financial accounting topics. Volume III draws together literature in which paradigmatic issues have been debated heatedly and those that have reflected a tendency towards consensus and joint venturing.",
